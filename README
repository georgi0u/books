A test project to see if I can learn node, etc.

I like to read books.

I want to create a small app that lets you display the books you've read along with your personal synopsis of those books. 

I do this kind of thing all the time: read a book and then write a little blurb on: how it affected me, what I thought about the ideas presented, what conclusions I drew from the information presented, etc.. I think it would be nice to have a consolidated, organized, collection of these thoughts. 

What's more, I think the information that book titles represent, as well as the quality of the ideas themselves, form somewhat of a model by which the reader of those books can be associated with. Books are a personal expression, not only of the author, but of the reader!

For example, if I know that a person has read a book I find to be particularly profound, I may be more inclined to think the reader is interesting, or at least I might be more inclined to find out.
